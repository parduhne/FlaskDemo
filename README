Notes:

We are using docker to standardize the python and flask versions.  No files are stored in the container, but rather we mount the current folder inside for execution with all software in the container.

When in this folder with the Dockerfile, do:

to create an image.  This has python and flask.

When ready to start the server, do
docker run -it -v `pwd`:/web -p 5000:5000 flaskrunner

You'll get a new prompt once in the container.
python3 app.py        This will run the application and serve pages on port 5000
                      Due to the port map, it will be available on your computer as well
                      via the port forward specifed during run above.
                      This will restart when a file changes (very useful!)
                      Ctrl-c to stop.
                      Or you can use 'flask run --host=0.0.0.0'

python3 -m pytest test
